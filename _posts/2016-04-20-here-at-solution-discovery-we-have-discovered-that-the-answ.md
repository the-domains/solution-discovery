Here at Solution Discovery, we have discovered that the answers - and questions - that precede a paradigm shift for an individual or group, existed within them already.

We are particularly selective about the kinds of people who we will facilitate and co-create. What is your legacy to the planet children on the other side of the globe may one day thank you for? An alternate strategy that reverses Amazon de-forestation? That ends poverty on our own streets, that empowers the sick to return to health? That contributes verified, unbiased facts to enable the decision-making of any electorate, creating checks and balances to party propaganda and political bluster? That democratises end empowers each human being to be a valued global citizen? That secures fuel independence, cancels sovereign debt of struggling nations andprovudes plentiful, free clean drinking water for every human being?

We are facilitators. Your successful completion of your stated outcomes and independence from us is facilitated to be as early as responsibly possible. Our own success is a function of how few clients we are actively working with and the impact and effect those clients are creating, rather than how many we are working with.

We work with people and organisations and enterprises who want to leave the world a better place than they found it. To serve their fellow human beings (not necessarily to please them) and to improve the quality of life for the greatest number of people possible. To set out to address and create solutions to the grand challenges humanity faces, harnessing and firing collective intuition, innate ingenuity, creativity and human curiosity. To re-define our respective industries and demonstrate how win-win-win business is not just a possibility but a probability.

Every woman, man and child alive today is creating the foundations shaping the world our own children will inherit. The planet has changed. People now have access to more connectivity to share ideas and philosophies than ever before. The time to act is now. 

We're A-political. Un-biased. Judgement free. Challenging. Controversial. Contrarian. It's not about us, it's about the difference you will make. You already possess the questions and answers, and the intuitions and innate ingenuity within your nervous system to create a viable solution. Only you can achieve your outcome: it took your experience and insight to create the possibility. No-one is likely better equipped.

The status quo is the strongest competitor. She has a significant influence, but she is not invincible. It's not our job to motivate or inspire or to 'sell' you on doing what you have it in you to be. That's your prerogative. Decide to be that which you have it in you to be, and you will reap what you sow.
